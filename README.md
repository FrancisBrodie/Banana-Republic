# Banana-Republic Front-End Mentor Challenge

## Getting started 

```
npm init
npm install --save
```

```
npm install --save serve
// add start script to package json: "start": "serve"
```

```
npm start
// in console
```

## toggle button 
``` 
I have not cracked that one as yet, I have added a closing link for the meantime and kept my working for the toggle there however commented out. I did almost add another button but I thought that would not be what you wanted. I did get pretty close however an obvious gap in my abilities, for now that is. 
```

## slide box
``` 
Another close one, almost got it to render the whole section however I believe it is a margin or padding issue which I have fussed with in js and also css however no cigar as yet. 
```

## Check boxes
```
Another almost, I have kept the gender checkboxes visible and hidden the 'Membership' ones as I have not cracked the display yet. So close.
```

##  Date Of Birth 
``` 
Tried my best on that one, haven't worked with svg's much/at all. Definite room for improvement. 
```

## Media Query 

``` 
Sooo I have only followed one youTube tutorial on this subject in the past, I think it's going to take some practice, managed for the most part however when it comes to displaying the text above the form fields I have had no joy, when I change my flex direction the SVG image display is an actual nightmare. I am sure there is an easy fix for this, I just haven't learnt it yet. 
```

## Animations 
```
I learnt animations last week, I think I just need a bit more exposure and I'll be A for away. 
```
